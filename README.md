This app uses bootstrap, node, and react

First select the type of transaction (Deposit, or Cash Back), then enter the amount. The input field will not appear until a selection has been made.

If a Cash Back transaction exceeds the amount of funds currently available the submit box will be disabled.

Every transaction will be recorded with the latest transaction appearing at the top of the list.

I am currently working on adding a Toast pop-up that will display in the event that the account is about to be overdrawn.
